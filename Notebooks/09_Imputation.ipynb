    "Do not impute inconsistent/partial variables by default. Only consider imputation if the variable is conceptually indispensable and FMI suggests the information can be credibly recovered (e.g., plausible MAR with auxiliary predictors).\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s not reasonable to impute inconsistent/partial variables without first considering FMI and context. Imputation is not a neutral operation; it encodes assumptions about the missingness mechanism, temporal comparability, and the meaning of the variable. If a variable is inconsistent across months/years, imputing it can fabricate continuity that wasn’t in the data, undermining factor analysis and comparability across regions and time.\n",

    "**Tier 1 — Consistent variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Action: Eligible for imputation.\n",
    "- Rule: Use FMI to determine imputation intensity (light/cautious/advanced).\n",
    "- Justification: Stable measurement; imputation supports matrix completion for EFA.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tier 2 — Partial variables (intermittent presence or minor coding drift):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Action: Conditional imputation.\n",
    "- Rule: Impute only if FMI is moderate/high but MAR plausibility exists via auxiliary predictors, and coding is harmonized; otherwise flag for sensitivity analysis.\n",
    "- Justification: Limited comparability; treat as supporting evidence, not core FA inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tier 3 — Inconsistent variables (structural changes, major coding breaks):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Action: Do not impute for FA.\n",
    "- Rule: Document and retain for diagnostics; consider future harmonization projects or use in qualitative context.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Justification: Imputation would manufacture comparability and can distort factor structure.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Why imputing inconsistent variables without FMI review is not defensible?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurement instability:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Inconsistent variables often arise because the survey question changed, coding shifted, or the variable wasn’t asked in some rounds. Imputing them blindly assumes the missingness is random noise, when in fact it reflects structural differences. That creates false comparability across years.\n",
    "**Factor analysis assumptions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "FA assumes each variable measures the same construct across all observations. If a variable is inconsistent, imputing values fabricates continuity that wasn’t there. This risks producing spurious factors that look “interpretable” but are actually artifacts of imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Auditability and thesis defense:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The approved pipeline methodology emphasizes transparency and conceptual justification. If the team imputes inconsistent variables without FMI, reviewers can easily challenge: “Why did you treat structurally missing data as if it were random?”"
